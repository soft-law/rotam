# Rotam
Vehicle Marketplace secured by Polkadot

# Project Description

Rotam, a pioneering AppChain, is a second-hand vehicle marketplace that integrates legal, mechanical, and aesthetic verifications (NFTs) and valuations alongside liquidity pools for DeFi services. The platform's solution includes escrow contracts, paired with off-chain legal services, to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers in the second-hand car market; these contracts secure the off-chain delivery and sale paperwork, eliminating potential disputes and fraud.
